# Angular  
Angular + NodeJS + sqlite + TMDB (The Movie Database)  

Project made for college in Angular. This project was not part of github so it does not have any pushes, branches etc and doesn't have any documentation. This project is associated with NodeJS repository. Task was to switch NodeJS to Angular.  

Add TMDB api key in konfiguracija.csv file to successfully start servers.  

To run this project firstly open terminal and change directory to folder servis. Type in next command: node restServer.js ../rwa_dkajzogaj20_conf.csv  
Next open new terminal and change directory to folder Aplikacija. Type in next command: node appServer.js ../rwa_dkajzogaj20_conf.csv.  
To open app copy your port from second terminal and type in brower next: localhost:[PORT].  

angular folder is just angular build from original angular app.
